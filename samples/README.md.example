## Overview

<<CHANGE HERE>>
Brief description of what this product project is,
its scope, and its primary responsibility.

This repository is a **product project** developed under an explicit
**AI Directive**, which defines how AI systems (ChatGPT Desktop, Codex, etc.)
must behave when interacting with this codebase.

AI participation is treated as a **contract**, not an implicit convention.

---

## AI Directive (Authoritative)

This project adopts the **AI Directive** mounted at:

    ai/directive

The AI Directive is managed as a **git submodule** and treated as an
external, versioned contract shared across multiple projects.

### Authority and Priority

AI behavior MUST be interpreted in the following order:

1. **AI Directive**
   - ai/directive/core
   - Active profile (e.g. chatgpt-desktop, codex)
2. **Project-specific rules**
   - docs/rules/
3. Other documentation (docs/spec, docs/design, docs/notes, docs/journal)

The AI Directive is authoritative.
Project-specific rules may add constraints but MUST NOT implicitly override it.

[FIXED — contractual section]

---

## AI Entry Points

The following files are the **authoritative AI entry points** for this project:

- AGENT.md → symlink to ai/directive/core/AGENT.md
- RULE.md  → symlink to ai/directive/core/RULE.md

AI systems MUST start from these files.

No additional agent or rule files at the project root are authoritative.

[FIXED — by design]

---

## AI Profiles Used

This project uses the following AI profiles defined by the AI Directive:

- **chatgpt-desktop**
  - Interactive reasoning, design, review, and documentation
  - Human-in-the-loop
  - MUST NOT execute commands or modify files directly

- **codex**
  - Execution-only agent
  - Operates strictly under explicit execution instructions
  - MUST stop on ambiguity or unsafe conditions

Profile-specific rules are defined under:

    ai/directive/chatgpt-desktop/
    ai/directive/codex/

<<CHANGE HERE (OPTIONAL)>>
Describe any project-specific restrictions or extensions
to profile usage.

---

## Documentation Structure

Project documentation is organized into semantic layers under docs/:

- docs/notes/  
  Exploratory notes, hypotheses, and informal records  
  (non-normative, disposable)

- docs/design/  
  Architectural decisions, responsibility boundaries, and invariants

- docs/spec/  
  Behavioral specifications that implementations must satisfy

- docs/journal/  
  Chronological records (decisions, incidents, releases)

These layers are **not interchangeable**.
Each carries a distinct semantic weight.

### Documentation Lifecycle (Authoritative)

The authoritative definition of the documentation lifecycle,
including promotion rules and interpretation constraints, is defined in:

    ai/directive/core/document-lifecycle.md

AI systems and contributors MUST follow that document when creating,
moving, or interpreting documentation.

[DETAILS DEFERRED TO AI DIRECTIVE]

---

## Project-Specific Rules

Project-specific AI rules and constraints (if any) are defined under:

    docs/rules/

<<CHANGE HERE>>
Describe any project-specific constraints, phase conventions,
or explicit exceptions.

If docs/rules/ is empty, no additional project-specific constraints apply.

## Contribution Notes

- Do NOT modify files under ai/directive/ from this repository.
- Changes to shared AI behavior belong in the ai-directive repository.
- Updates to the AI Directive must be recorded as submodule updates.
- Documentation must respect the defined lifecycle and semantics.

<<CHANGE HERE (OPTIONAL)>>
Add project-specific contribution notes if required.

---

## Summary

This repository makes AI behavior **explicit, versioned, and reviewable**.

- The AI contract lives in ai/directive.
- This project explicitly adopts that contract.
- Documentation and code are interpreted under that shared understanding.
